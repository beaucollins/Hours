        <p><em>&ldquo;Forgive us our sin and we forgive those who sin against
        us.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
         <p>As the darkness surrounds this evening so let your love and mercy
        surround and fill me, and your whole church. Fragmented as I am,
        accept me. Forgive me for whatever I have left undone and for the
        things I did that were harmful. I offer to you all my anger for the
        things that were not as they should be. I offer to you all the people
        who wronged me this day. I ask you to forgive them. I pray that I
        would find in me a forgiving heart that trusts in your justice and
        relies on your mercy, in Jesus Christ.</p>
        
         <p><em>&ldquo;Save us from the time of trial and deliver us from
        evil.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
         <p>Into your hands I commend all I am and all I have. Grant me
        peaceful sleep and assurance of your protecting love even in my death,
        through Jesus Christ.</p>
        
         <p><em>(This prayer can be followed by Bible readings, thanks and
        prayers for others)</em></p>
